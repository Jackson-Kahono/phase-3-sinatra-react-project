## Description
*FRONTEND - This is a real estate application where a user will be able to buy or rent a home. A client and agency are able to log in or sign up at the landing page. They'll be able to search for a home with their preferences through a search filter for example prices, number of rooms etc. and the houses will be displayed together with their descriptions. Agencies are able to edit or create a new proerty on their page.

*BACKEND - We used Active Record to interact with the database. The project has three models which have a one-to-many relationship. It has API routes in sinatra that handles different CRUD actions for at least one of your Active Record models. The project has a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to perform CRUD actions.
